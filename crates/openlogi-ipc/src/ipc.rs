//! tarpc service contract between the GUI (client) and the agent (server).
//!
//! tarpc generates the `AgentClient` and the `serve` glue from this trait. tarpc
//! is strict request/response — no server push — so anything the agent needs to
//! *tell* a client is shaped as a request the client leaves open, and the agent
//! holds it until there is something to say or its hold window elapses.
//! [`Agent::observe`] is that channel for state: it answers the moment the
//! agent's observable state changes, and answers with the whole of it, so a
//! client needs no subscription and no replay to converge. `next_pairing` and
//! `next_action_ring` are the same shape for their own streams.
