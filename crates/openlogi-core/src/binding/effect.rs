//! A platform-neutral synthesis IR.
//!
//! [`Action`] has one variant per user-facing behaviour (52 of them), but the
//! three `openlogi-inject` backends don't care about most of that
//! granularity — they care about *mechanism*: "press this chord", "click
//! this mouse button", "fire this media key", "there is no portable way to
//! do this, use the OS-specific path". [`Action::effect`] is the single
//! exhaustive match that sorts every variant into one of those buckets, so
//! each backend matches on ~10-variant [`Effect`] instead of re-deriving the
//! full `Action` vocabulary three times.
//!
//! [`Shortcut`], [`MediaKey`], and [`NativeAction`] are semantic, not
//! mechanical: the same named shortcut is not the same chord on every OS
//! (`BrowserBack` is ⌘\[ on macOS, Alt+Left on Linux, and a dedicated
//! virtual key with no modifier on Windows), so each backend owns its own
//! lookup table from these enums to its platform's key/API. The
//! exhaustiveness check on those enums is what keeps all three backends
//! honest when a variant is added — a backend that forgets a case fails to
//! compile rather than silently no-op-ing.
