/// `GestureButton` matches what Logi Options+ ships for MX-line devices:
/// gesture button → Mission Control, captured per-direction (see
/// [`default_gesture_binding`]).
///
/// `GestureButton`'s entry here is vestigial: in the merged [`Binding`] model
/// the gesture button defaults to [`Binding::Gesture`] (see
/// [`default_binding_for`]), so this single-action value is never the source of
/// truth for it. It is retained only so the per-button-`Action` callers (the
/// hook map, scroll defaults, labels) stay total.
///
/// [`ButtonId::Thumbwheel`] — the wheel's capacitive tap — is deliberately
/// inert. The mouse model surfaces the wheel as one paired rotation control,
/// so the tap has no GUI hotspot to discover or clear it, while the firmware
/// reports a tap from incidental thumb contact (including mid-roll, from the
/// ridges alone). Seeding it with a real action therefore fired that action
/// for users who only changed the rotation bindings or the sensitivity — the
/// two settings that divert the wheel over `0x2150` in the first place. A tap
/// bound explicitly in the config still dispatches; only the seed is inert.
